"""
The aim of this module is to provide an infrastructure for handling assets -
like javascript or css files - in a web project. It is not intended to be
used directly; instead it provides footing for other modules. Those modules
making use of score.webassets' features should have a :term:`category
<asset category>` string, that can be used to distinguish different asset
types.

Currently it provides two features to be used by others - virtual assets and
asset versioning - as well as an adaption for the pyramid framework.

        used by other modules. The :mod:`css module <score.css>`, for example,
