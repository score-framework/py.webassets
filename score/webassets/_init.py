        A writable folder that will be used to cache intermediate values. This
        value is mostly unused in this module, but the initialized value can be
        used by other modules. The :mod:`css module <score.css>`, for example,
        will create a sub-folder beneath this folder, if it was initialized
        without an explicit `cachedir` of its own.

    :confkey:`versionmanager` :default:`score.webassets.versioning.Dummy`
        The :class:`VersionManager` to use. This value will be converted to an
        object using :func:`score.init.init_object`.

        See the :mod:`package description <score.webassets.versioning>` for
        available implementations.

    :confkey:`netfs` :default:`True`
        The initializer will upload all webassets to a :mod:`score.netfs`
        server, if one was configured. You can disable this feature by passing a
